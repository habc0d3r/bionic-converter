# Bionic-Converter
Just a simple program to convert texts from normal to **Bio**nic **read**ing **mo**de.

To use this program download it into your system. Open it in a code editor (VS Code, Pycharm). You will see a file named 'sample_text.txt'.
You can either replace this file's text with your own or you can even replace the file itself but don't forget to add your txt file and change
the file name inside 'main.py' code file.

After you run the program you will see two files inside a directory named 'bionic'. The one with the html extension has the desired output of 
the program. Open it in a browser. 
*This program will get updated* ... :)
